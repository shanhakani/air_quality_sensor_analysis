# Air Quality Sensor Anomaly Detection

This project analyzes air quality data using sensor readings from the UCI Air Quality dataset using Isolation Forest.

## Files

- `air_quality_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, visualizations, and results.
- `AirQualityUCI.csv`: Raw dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- `shakani7_final_report.pdf`: Final report summarizing the analysis and findings.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes hourly averaged responses from an array of chemical sensors deployed in an Italian city. It contains measurements of various air pollutants and meteorological data.

## Getting Started

1. Open `air_quality_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, shap).
3. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis.
